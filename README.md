1. Introduction
===============
Every club needs to handle its members. But how? I don't really like all these
excel sheets or commercial solutions. What about an Open-Source web application
which can be easily used?!

The default language for the output strings are in German, because I developed
this program for a German Club.


2. Functions
===============
What can you do with this application?

- add new club members
- give access to members who needs to view the list/bank data of your members
- add some information on the start page or on the first page which can be seen
after login


3. How it works
===============

Without any login you see the default start page with the login menu part on top:

After pressing the login menu part, you see the login-mask where you login with
email and password. Default:  
**Email**: foo@bar.de  
**Pwd**:testPassword

After the login you can choose between two different options (Benutzer and
Vereinsmitglieder)
